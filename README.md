### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Node.js**

   - **Download Node.js**:
      - Visit [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
      - Click on the recommended download link (most likely the LTS version) and follow the installer instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

   - **On macOS**: Use `Command + Space`, type `Terminal`, and hit Enter.

3. **Install `http-server`**

   - Once Node.js is installed, run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     ```
   - This command installs a simple web server that will serve the application files.

4. **Running the Application**

   - Use the terminal or command prompt to navigate to the directory where you have saved the `dnd` folder. To do this:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/dnd
     ```
   - Start the server by executing:
     ```bash
     http-server
     ```
   - Note the URL displayed in the terminal, typically something like `http://localhost:8080`.
